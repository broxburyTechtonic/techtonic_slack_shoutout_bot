### Testing

There are a few different tools being used for testing this application. All of the infrastructure and an example is in place, but these docs may be helpful:

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) - The main testing framework

[JestDOM](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) - extends jest assertions with more DOM-friendly phrases.

[Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/) - Provides lots of DOM selectors, user events, etc. Check out the core documentation and the Vue testing library as well.
